### Km Invoice Helper

EPC QR Codes for ERPNext users within the European Union. Contrary to other implementations, we compile the necessary data points and store the resulting code as a string in the database when the invoice is saved or submitted. 

That way, no on-the-fly graphics generation breaks the scheduled creation of invoices such as in subscriptions. No extra libraries necessary either, ERPNext's preferred PDF tool wkhtmltopdf has all we need.

Turns out, payment improves with an EPC. Less mistakes are made by the payor and more correct payment references are seen even from the sloppy of accountants (they are never sloppy, are they;)

### Installation

You can install this app using the [bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench) CLI:

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
bench get-app git@github.com:fnznhnzn/km_invoice_helper.git --branch main
bench install-app km_invoice_helper
```
Now add a custom field "custom_qr_code_base64" to Sales Invoice, Text + Read Only

...and finally for the codes to appear in your invoices add to your print formats:
```
{% if doc.custom_qr_code_base64 %} <img src="{{ doc.custom_qr_code_base64 | safe }}" /> {% endif %}
```
And... done!

Done!
